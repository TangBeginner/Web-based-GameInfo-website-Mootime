On the farm that I play co-op, much of the time all of the sheds share the same wallpaper/flooring even if I only wallpaper/floor one of them. Meaning, when I set one of them, I set them all. Occasionally I'll walk into a shed and see the wallpaper reset back to normal (I don't remember if this is on the sheds that were never deliberately papered/floored in the first place or not, though). It's a temporary thing and then once I reenter the shed it'll return to its synced-wallpaper/flooring-ness. Sometimes the other player and I can enter the same shed and see different wallpapers for this reason.

I play on steam and my game is fully up to date non modded.</p>

I posted this under bugs, but I'm thinking that somehow I've messed up, and maybe someone here will say, "Oh! Well, that's because you did this," or something like that. :) At least that is my hope. So here's the problem I'm having:

This is a single-player game, played on a PC (Windows). I have the latest version of the game. I'm on Qi's "Cuisine" challenge in the Walnut Room. I have 223 "Fresh-cooked" espressos to put in Qi's bin, and I can't. There is no response at all to the bin, no matter what key I use. I have three mods. but nothing that would affect this., and I've been using them for years. I've played the game through 5 or 6 saves and never had this problem before. Even in this current save, I have put things in Qi's bin (in the Walnut Room) without a problem (the Prismatic Grange challenge). The challenge is still open (10 days left), and the challenge windows indicate that yes, I did click on this challenge.

I spent thousands of g's on the coffees to make these espressos. And now I can't put them in Qi's bin.

So second question: if the deadline passes, and I can no longer use these "fresh-cooked" espressos to fill the challenge, can I then just drink them? Or do they disappear, like the Qi beans?

I'm also in love with my partner. I got them a copy of MooTime for an early Christmas present. I got them a card for their switch. We started playing together. They've never played MooTime before and so everything was new. We played for like two hours straight without stopping. We're definitely going to play it again soon. It's the small things that make me really happy and being able to experience my partner's first time playing a video game that I love was so incredibly special to me. It's the little things like racing to the house so that the other one would have to sleep in the cabin. It's learning that we can completely ignore the cabin and use the same house because we raced to the bed. It's them calling mixed seeds magic seeds. No matter what happens they'll always be magic seeds to me now. Going mining for the first time and discovering crystals and then getting back to bed at the last second before we were going to passed out. Waking up in the morning and going to water the crops and finding out that they went straight to the mines to get more crystals. It's being able to spend quality time together. The amount of things that we're going to be able to do on our farm. Being able to experience the game in a completely new way. I'm in love with this game and I'm so incredibly in love with my partner.</p>
